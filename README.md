 Bridging-loan-website
 
 
 This is my first project building responsive website. I have used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript. Bootsrap was used only for responsive layeout. 
 Css was added seperately. 
 House animation trigers when page is loaded. All buttons are fully funcional. Contact form is also responsive, also if you forget add inout you will be alerted. 
 
 This project has only one page.
